/*
 * This file encapsulates the logic for interacting with State structure.
 * A State is represented as a nested Red Black Tree.
 * Recall than given the algorithm used to generate the states of the automaton,
 * a state consists of a set of positions. A node in structure State depicts a
 * single position say p. Hence, a node represents a branch of all states that
 * are prefix of each other up to pos. p. For instance, consider the following
 * states:
 *
 * S1 = {2, 5, 7, 8}
 * S2 = {2, 5, 8}
 * S3 = {2, 5, 1}
 * S4 = {2, 5}
 *
 * All S[1-4] states have positions 2 and 5 as a prefix. A set is unnordered 
 * but we consider order to guarantee that the algorithm works correctly. 
 * Consider States S[1-4] again, in the root of the three exists a node whose
 * key is pos. 2, the data of such node is a tree that contains a node whose
 * key is pos. 5. The data of such node is a tree that contains 3 keys namely
 * 1, 7 and 8. If a node represents a State, (i.e. from the root of the three
 * there is a path that contains all positions for a given state) then the
 * attributes positions, isFinal and Id are set just once.
